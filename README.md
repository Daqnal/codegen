# Codegen

Codegen is a simple yet advanced password and PIN generator.

It can generate 3 types of passwords:
- Alphanumeric (A-Z, 0-9)
- Symbolic (Any character that can be typed on a standard WASD keyboard)
- PIN (0-9)

As well as the ability to copy the text by selection, there is a button that will automatically copy the password.

A counter is included to specify the length of the password

The entirety of the code has no connection to the internet and does not save any of your passwords into a file, so they are 100% secure.
