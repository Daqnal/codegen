It can generate 3 types of passwords:
- Symbolic (Any character that can be typed on a standard QWERTY keyboard)

A counter is included to specify the length of the password

As well as the ability to copy the text by selection, there is a button that will automatically copy the password.

The entirety of the code has no connection to the internet and does not save any of your passwords into a file, so they are 100% secure.
